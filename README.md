# Diabetic Retinopathy Risk Prediction
* Developed a machine learning-based system to predict diabetic retinopathy risk from clinical features such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
* Trained multiple ML models including Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost; CatBoost delivered the highest performance with 75\% accuracy.
* Built a preprocessing and evaluation pipeline for consistent model comparison and validation.
* Deployed the CatBoost model using Streamlit to enable real-time user input and risk prediction.
